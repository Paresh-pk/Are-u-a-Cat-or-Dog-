# Are-u-a-Cat-or-Dog-
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for building, training, and tracking a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses TensorFlow/Keras for model building and leverages MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking, from local development to a production-ready cloud setup on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
